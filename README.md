# Redirectinator
Is a clone of [https://grabify.link/](https://grabify.link/) made with nodejs, parse js, and reactjs. You can add domains that you own and as long as you forward it to the server you can use it to snipe ip addresses and other information from people who open links.

## Technology
Uses parse for the backend ( a competitor to firebase but is now deperiated so its self hosted only ). The front end is all in react. 

## How To set Up
In Both website and server you'll need to run `yarn install` and then for the website `yarn start`. To start the server you'll need to run ` yarn add express body-parser nunjucks parse/node`.
